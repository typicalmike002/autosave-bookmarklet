# autosave-bookmarklet
A tool to be used for autosaving html forms each time a user alters some data inside a html input form.  I created this while working at a data entry job that invovled very large html forms and while learning about javascript local storage and discovering bookmarklets in the process, I built this to save my progress as I filled out a html form. Things like the power going out or hitting refresh by accident would normally mean I would have to redo the entire form but with autosave-bookmarklet, losing progress while filling out data is a thing of the past. 

## Install autosave-bookmarklet
There are a few ways to start using autosave-bookmarklet.  The easiest way is to copy/paste all the code from autosave.js into the url of a bookmark.  Activating the bookmark will work on any website running in your browser.  Another way is to pull this project and load the autosave-bookmarklet.html file into a browser and add the hyperlink there to your bookmark manager.

## Some Notes
- autosave-bookmarklet will only save a single html form. 
- This is only suppose to be a safety net for filling out huge html forms.
- autosave-bookmarklet clears old data each time it is loaded.
- Useful for filling out large html forms on not very user friendly websites.
- Good websites shouldn't need this bookmarklet but again not all websites are good.
